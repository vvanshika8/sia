## Code Outline:

**1. Data Generation (generate_data):**

* Takes minimum and maximum values for x, and the desired number of data points as input.
* Generates random integers within the specified range for x.
* Returns a tuple containing the generated x and y arrays.

**2. Manual Prediction (ymxc):**

* Takes x values, slope (m), and y-intercept (c) as input.
* Calculates y values using the linear equation y = mx + c.
* Returns a NumPy array containing the predicted y values.

**3. Gradient Descent with Learning Rate (MandC):**

* Takes x, ground truth y (Y_gt), predicted y (Y_pred), and learning rate (L) as input.
* Calculates the number of data points (n).
* Initializes slope (m) and y-intercept (c) with random values.
* Iterates for a specified number of times (N):
    * Calculates predicted y values using current m and c.
    * Calculates the error term (e) as the difference between ground truth and predicted y.
    * Calculates the derivatives of the error term w.r.t. m (dm) and c (dc) using vectorized operations.
    * Updates m and c using the learning rate and the calculated derivatives.
* Returns the updated slope (m) and y-intercept (c).

**4. Closed-Form Solution (linear_regression):**

* Takes x and y arrays as input.
* Calculates the mean of x and y values.
* Calculates the slope (m) and y-intercept (c) using the closed-form solution for linear regression.
* Returns a tuple containing the calculated slope (m) and y-intercept (c).

**5. Error Term Calculation (error_term):**

* Takes true y and predicted y values as input.
* Calculates the error term (e) for each data point by subtracting predicted y from true y.
* Returns a NumPy array containing the error terms.

**6. Main Script:**

* Generates data using `generate_data`.
* Performs manual prediction (`ymxc`) with predefined values for m and c.
* Plots the data and the manual regression line.
* Performs gradient descent with a learning rate using `MandC`.
* Calculates slope and intercept using the closed-form solution (`linear_regression`).
* Calculates the error term for both manual and learned predictions (`error_term`).
